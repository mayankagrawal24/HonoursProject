# Podify - An App to Always Remember your Podcasts.

Podify is a mobile application that is created to help individuals better remember
information that they hear while listening to podcasts. Podcast listeners often face the harsh
reality of struggling to remember the content that they have just spent the last hour listening to.
Podify enables its users to automatically be notified when they begin listening to a podcast and
gives them a sleek and effective platform to store notes on their thoughts regarding their favorite
podcasts. Podify also enables its users to see what other users are listening to, and even see what
others are thinking about certain podcasts. Podify uses Spotify as the podcast listening platform
that the users must connect to give it access to the userâ€™s podcast listening information.
